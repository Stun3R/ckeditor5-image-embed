# ckeditor5-image-embed
Embed Image via Url is currently unsupported by Ckeditor 5 default.

Everything that could make your site partial in-secure is not recommended by Ckeditor 5.
Therefore Embed Image via Url feature suffer the same destiny.

This version only works on @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic, but you can take the idea to do whatever you want.

Enjoy!
